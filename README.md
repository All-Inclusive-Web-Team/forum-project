## Set up

Project Dependencies: Node(version 16.11.1 or higher), PostgreSQL(version 13.8 or higher)
Older versions may work with this project but to avoid getting any unforeseen bugs, we recommend using the versions listed above.

# Front end only set up coming soon!

# Full stack set up:

# 1. Installing all node dependencies

In your terminal go to directory aict-site-w-react and run npm install. Now the frontend is good to go and doesn't require any further set up.
Then in your terminal go to directory backend-of-aict-site-w-react and run npm install. All modules will be installed but the backend does require
further set up.

# 2. DB set up

In your terminal, go to directory All-Inclusive-Web-Team.github.io/aict-PERN-forum/backend-of-aict-site-w-react/schemas/forum_schema/.
From there, start postgres by running psql, then the command \i forum_schema.sql. If all goes well, your db should be all set and ready to go
and the project set up is complete. If you run into errors, please reach out for help on the discord server.
